# MPG VPlan

The companion app for students of the [Max-Planck-Gymnasium](http://mpg-umstadt.de) in Groß-Umstadt, Hesse. Powered by [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/)

Find it on the iOS App Store here! (Soon™)
Or on the [Google Play Store here](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.mpgumstadt.mpgvplan)!
For a Windows version, take a look at [this repository](https://github.com/mpggu/mobileAppWin).

Get an always up-to-date and nicely designed representation of the substitution plan, instead of finding out your next four classes are cancelled after an 30 minute long bus drive.
